# Poetry using RNN

Implementing a simple LSTM RNN model using Keras to train on a dataset consisting of poems. The model is trained character by character and performs a decent task in understanding the structure of a poem and several words. In different iterations, with different initial random seeds, it even produces a few rhyming words.
